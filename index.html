<p>
I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/global-economics-and-management/phd-program">Global Economics and Management</a> program at Anderson School of Management, UCLA. I completed my Master of Public Policy degree from <a href="http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/">Harris School of Public Policy</a> at <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/index.shtml">University of Chicago</a> in June 2013. 
</p>

<p>
I am interested in poverty and development issues in emerging economies. Specifically, I want to understand how the incentives of various stakeholders such as politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens vary. I also want to analyze the impact of this variation towards achieving intended developmental outcomes.
</p>

<p>
I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from University of Delhi. I started my career with Cisco Systems as a software developer in their Core Routing Business Unit. I then moved to a <a href="http://praja.in">start-up</a> which was interested in urban development issues. Most of my time here was spent on building our online platform and collaborating with citizen groups who could potentially use the platform. I followed it with a stint at a public policy think-tank - <a href="http://schoolchoice.in">Center for Civil Society</a>. At CCS, I focussed on the elementary education sector with an emphasis on school choice and the then recently legislated Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.

<h4 id="sec-2-1-1">Enforcement in Value Added Tax: Is Third Party Verification Effective? (with <a href="https://are.berkeley.edu/~aprajit/">Aprajit Mahajan</a>)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-1">
<p>
A key stated advantage of the value-added tax (VAT) is that it allows the tax authority to verify transactions by comparing seller and buyer transaction reports. However, there is little evidence on how these paper trails actually affect VAT collections particularly in low compliance environments. We use a unique data set (the universe of VAT returns for the Indian state of Delhi over five years) and the timing of a policy that improved the tax authority's  information about buyer-seller interactions to shed light on this issue.  Using a difference-in-difference strategy we find that the policy had a large and significant effect on wholesalers relative to retailers. We also document significant heterogeneity with almost the entire increase being driven by changes in the behavior of the largest firms. We also find suggestive evidence that information and enforcement are complementary. Finally, we discuss the details of the policy implementation and argue that this policy which seems simple in principle, faces substantial hurdles in execution, particularly in a system with limited resources.

<h4 id="sec-2-1-2">Who's Bogus? Using Machine Learning to Identify Fraudulent Firms (with Aprajit Mahajan, Ofir Reich)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-1-2">
<p>
Improving the state's ability to tax effectively is increasingly seen as central to the development process and value added tax (VAT) is often proposed as a key tool towards accomplishing this goal.  However, VAT implementation in many low compliance environments is plagued by firms generating false paper trails. This demand for false paper trails has led to the creation of fraudulent firms (referred to as ``bogus" firms by tax authorities) which issue fake receipts to genuine firms that allow the latter to lower their tax liability. We are requesting pilot funding to initiate the first stage of a long-term intervention to improve tax collections in Delhi (India).  In this stage, we plan to apply machine learning methods on a large network data set (the universe of all tax returns for five years from Delhi) to identify fraudulent firms and then use on-the-field verification of such guesses to further improve the machine learning algorithm. In the second stage, we plan to implement an RCT with the tax authority that compares the authority's current method to our data-driven approach towards identifying fraudulent firms.

With <a href="http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/global-economics-and-management/faculty/wacziarg">Prof Romain Wacziarg</a>, I used the World Values Survey data to compute various measures of cultural distance between countries.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-4">Evaluation of Right to Public Service Schemes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-4">
<p>
With <a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/marianne.bertrand/index.html">Professor Marianne Bertrand</a> and <a href="http://dss.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/">Professor Paul Niehaus</a>, I evaluated the implementation of Right to Public Services Act that was introduced in Karnataka, India. We analysed the government data on service requests to figure out patterns related to accuracy of information being captured and time to resolution of requests. (The report is available upon request)
</p>

<p>
I went to Karnataka to understand the design and implementation of the Act. I interacted with all the government level stakeholders and visited various government offices to witness the ground realities. I developed and piloted a survey questionnaire which captured the experience and perception of citizens who avail the services that are covered under the Act.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-5">Measuring performance and analysing time-use of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-5">
<p>
This project was also with Professor Marianne Bertrand and Professor Paul Niehaus. I undertook a ﬁeld trip to Bihar, India to understand the time-use of district magistrates. Here, I shadowed 2 district magistrates for a week each for as much time as they permitted. The goal of the exercise was multi-fold: to grasp the variation in the tasks that a district magistrate undertakes, to understand the dynamics of her relationship with all the agents she interacts with, the constraints in which she is expected to deliver, and her role and responsibilities. Another aim of the exercise was to understand the organisational setup at the state/district/sub-district level.  
</p>

<p>
I developed time-use tracking forms and survey questionnaires for the district magistrates, formulated Right to Information Act questionnaires to get data which could help measure the performance of district level IAS oﬃcers as part of their statutory &amp; regulatory responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
In the initial stages, I reviewed government documents to understand the statutory and developmental responsibilities of IAS oﬃcers and narrowed the research problem. Between all this, I wrote perl scripts to get election data for national and state level elections (1980 onwards) in India.

<h4 id="sec-2-2-6">Effect of name order in Senate roll call voting pattern</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-2-2-6">
<p>
Under <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/uchicago.edu/bpmontagnes/home">Professor Pablo Montagnes</a>, I analysed the impact of the order in which a senator is called to vote on her voting behavior. We are able to do this because Senators in the US are called to vote in the order of their last names. <br  />
</p>

<p>
Using combined fixed effects at the senator level and at the congress level, we show that the agreement level of the senators with their party goes up as we go down the order. The major magnitude of the result is being driven by party unity. Senators also get signal from
the way in which senators from her party have already voted (bandwagon effect).
</p>

<p>
Besides doing the stata analysis, I also wrote perl scripts to extract senate and house roll-call data from 1940 into an analysable data set.

I don't claim to be a computer science nerd but from time to time I wonder if there was a better way to do the task that I was performing. This page is for people like me. Here, I list tools that I have used, and found useful and fascinating. All of them are free and have an active online community. They made my work efficient and fun. If you think I should add something to this list, I am always up for trying new useful tools. (Disclaimer: In some cases, I would not have latched on to these tools had it not been for my computer sciency geeky friends.)

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-0-1">
<p>
If you are looking to create a website which goes beyond text/html/css requirements, drupal is it. A lot of times one needs to include functionalities which are complicated but fairly common. Think integrating google maps, blogs, forums, wikis, anything and everything into one website. Chances are that you will find a module in Drupal which suits your needs closely.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-0-2">
<p>
If you look into government data developing countries, chances are you regularly come across data with spelling and naming inconsistencies. Google Refine helps you solve that problem. There are other ways in which people have gotten around this problem (reclink command in stata, Prof Bhavnani wrote an <a href="http://www.rikhilbhavnani.com/RB-AMIN.exe%20documentation.pdf">application</a>). I have not tried those other ways. Besides, this one has the google name behind it.

<h4 id="sec-5-0-3">FrontlineSMS (<a href="http://www.frontlinesms.com/">Link</a>)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-0-3">
<p>
There are lot of SMS server offerings out there. One has to pay for them and be sure of what she wants. On top of that, those services usually require you to have access to internet - a luxury not easily available in developing countries. FrontlineSMS allows you to create and manage common SMS activities such as making announcements, conducting polls and sending automatic replies to incoming SMS. Potentially, a great tool to collect data from the field. All one needs is a laptop and a mobile phone.

<h4 id="sec-5-0-4">Ushahidi (<a href="http://www.ushahidi.com">Link</a>)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-0-4">
<p>
Crowdsourcing is going to be the way to collect data in the near future. Think many kind of issues (<a href="http://votereport.pk/">election violations</a>, <a href="http://www.prijavikorupcija.org/">transparency</a>, etc.)  getting reported live and coming up on a map in a crowd sourced manner. Ushahidi will enable that.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-0-5">
<p>
These tools have a little steep learning curve but once you cross it, they are addictive! I use emacs to write and edit: assignments, papers, presentations, latex files, scripts, anything and everything. One can open multiple files in the same window and then compile them from there itself. 
Mouse becomes redundant. Org-mode allows you to create to-do lists, track agendas, create text files and then very easily export them to other formats such as latex, pdfs and htmls. 
</p>

<p>
This website was completely built in emacs and org-mode.

<p>
b. Convert from text to csv (<a href="http://shekhar.me/scripts/createtxt2csv.pl">Download</a>)<br  />
