* About
I am a Master of Public Policy student in [[harrisschool.uchicago.edu][Harris School of Public Policy]] at [[http://www.uchicago.edu/index.shtml][University of Chicago]], Chicago. My expected graduation date is June 2013. 
I have been working with Prof. Marianne Bertrand at Booth Graduate School of Business since April, 2012. I have also been working with Prof Pablo Montagnes at Harris School of Public Policy since January, 2012. 

I am interested in poverty and development issues in emerging economies. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how the incentives of various stakeholders such as politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens vary and need to be consider this variation towards achieving intended policy outcomes.

I am from India. I received an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from University of Delhi. I started my career with Cisco Systems as a Software Engineer in their Core Routing Business Unit. It did not take me long to realise that life of a full time software engineer will not be fulfilling.
