  developmental responsibilities of IAS officers and narrowed the
  research problem.

\textsc{January 2012 -- March 2012}\\
[[http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/directory/faculty/b-pablo_montagnes][Harris School of Public Policy]], University of Chicago \\

* Writing
- \emph{Working Paper:} ``What's in a name? Effect of name order in
  Senate roll call'' with Dan Magleby and Pablo Montagnes,
  September 2012.
  
  \emph{Summary:} The paper shows that the alphabetical order of
  Senator's last names has an impact on the way they cast their
  votes. Using senator fixed effects, we find that senators who vote
  last are more likely to agree with their party.

- \emph{Short Paper:} ``Distance as an instrument for measuring
  centralized control in government schools'', December 2012.

  \emph{Summary:} The paper shows that the quality and outcomes of a
  government school deteriorate as the distance of a government school
  from district headquarters increases. This effect is absent in
  private schools which tend to be decentralized.

- \emph{Policy Memo:} ``Reservation in Private Schools under the Right
  to Education Act: Model for Implementation'', Shekhar Mittal and
  Parth J Shah, December 2010.

  \emph{Summary:} The memo suggests a model for effective
  implementation of a specific provision under the Right of Children
  to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. \\
