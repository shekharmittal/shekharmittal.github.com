\section{Writing}
\label{sec-3}


\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Short Paper:} ``Distance as an instrument for measuring
  centralized control in government schools'', December 2012.

  \emph{Summary:} The paper shows that the quality and outcomes of a
  government school deteriorate as the distance of a government school
  from district headquarters increases. This effect is absent in
  private schools which tend to be decentralized.
\item \emph{Research Design as part of course-work:} ``Indian Politics: The
  Criminals beget Criminals Effect'', May 2012.
 
  \emph{Summary:} I create a research design that uses regression
  discontinuity design to prove that when the incumbent in Indian
  elections is a criminal, and the opposition party thinks that there
  is a high probability of the election being close, the opposition
  party also tends to nominate a criminal.

\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Policy Memo:} ``Reservation in Private Schools under the Right
  to Education Act: Model for Implementation'', Shekhar Mittal and
  Parth J Shah, December 2010.

  \emph{Summary:} The memo suggests a model for effective
  implementation of a specific provision under the Right of Children
  to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. \\
